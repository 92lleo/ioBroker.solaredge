## solaredge adapter for ioBroker

Get data from solaredge monitoring portal.
Currently, only the /overview data point is used to get the current power and day/month/year/lifetime energy readings.

You can also enable modbus on your solaredge device if it's a newer one and read the data directly. 

You need your site id and api key to use this adapter. To get these, go to https://monitoring.solaredge.com  
site id: log in, site id is the "ID" on the right, eg 12345  
api key: log in, go to the admin settings and enable api access there. If you don't see admin settings, send a mail to solaredge to enable admin for your account.

* Add power and energy details
* Add other devices than inverters
